# TheDarkArtificesWordSearch
## About
The program is a themed story line word search based off of The Shadowhunter Chronicles book realm. The program is based off of a previous project. Where the general approach to the project is the same but with new concepts, themes, and solutions. 
## Technical Overview
The class works along with these classes: Stack, StopWatch, WordSearch, and WordSearchSolver in order to allow user to see their timed rounds via scoreboard, solve word search puzzles based on the theme. 
The menu prompts and allows user to start playing the game, look at game instructions,  scoreboard, and exit the game. They go through the game through the perspective of Emma Carstairs. Once they start playing the game their duration playing the game is timed, depending on the duration of the first round, they will have a different storyline and word  search. If user solves both word searches, they are prompted with missing words and a fill in the blank. If user enters the fill in the  blank sucessfully, they are shown the scoreboard. User can exit the game at any point. Once exiting the game or finishing the game, user is reprompted with the menu.
## User Guide
To run the program, a jar file is sufficient since it's a command line interface.
## Improvements
The scoreboard has some issues with sorting the ranks at times and so the file for the scoreboard may be incorrect.
